# this class is like Dictionary but keeps the order new key-pairs are added
from collections import OrderedDict # works as ordered Dictionary
# create an instance of the OrderedDict class. Notice there are no curly brackets; the call to OrderedDict() 
# creates an empty ordered dictionary for us and stores it in favorite_languages. We then add each name and language
# to favorite_languages one at a time

# add new key-pairs to clas as if it were a list. This is a great class to be aware of 
# because it combines the main benefit # of lists (retaining your original order) with 
# the main feature of dictionaries (connecting pieces of information).
