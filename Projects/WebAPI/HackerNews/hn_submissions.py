    Above we store the number of comments in the dictionary. If an article has 
    no comments yet, the key 'descendants' will not be present. When you're not 
    sure if a key exists in a dictionary, use the dict.get() method,which returns
    the value associated with the given key if it exists or the value you provide
    if the key doesn't exist (0 in this example).

'''
Above we sort the list of dictionaries by the number of comments. 
To do this, we use a function called itemgetter(), which comes
from the operator module. We pass this function the key 'comments', 
and it pulls the value associated with that key from each dictionary 
in the list. The sorted() function then uses this value as its basis 
for sorting the list. We sort the list in reverse order to place 
the most-commented stories first.
