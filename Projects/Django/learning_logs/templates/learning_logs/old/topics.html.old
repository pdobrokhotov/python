<!--================= The Topics Template ======================
The template for the topics page receives the context dictionary 
so the template can use the data that topics() provides
=============================================================-->
<!-- Inherit from base.html -->
{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}
<!-- Content specific to this page onlt -->
{% block content %}
  <p>Topics</p>
  <ul>
    <!--============== LOOP ======================================================= 
    Here we have another template tag equivalent to a for loop, which loops
    through the list topics from the context dictionary. The code used in templates
    differs from Python in some important ways. Python uses indentation
    to indicate which lines of a for statement are part of a loop. In a template,
    every for loop needs an explicit 'endfor' tag indicating where the end of
    the loop occurs. Variable in a template should be wrapped in double braces.
    Thus code 'topic' will be replaced by the value of topic-variable
     ===========================================================================-->
    {% for topic in topics %}
       <!--
       We use the URL template tag to generate the proper link, based on
       the URL pattern in learning_logs with the name 'topic'. This URL pattern
       requires a topic_id argument, so we add the attribute topic.id to the URL
       template tag. Now each topic in the list of topics is a link to a topic page,
       such as http://localhost:8000/topics/17/.
       Note, that in the book href-link was url = 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id
       but it DID NOT work and I pepleced it to = 'topic' topic.id
       <li>{{ topic }}</li>
       <h3><a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}">{{ topic }}</a></h3>
       -->
      <li><a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}">{{ topic }}</a></li>
    {% empty %} <!-- print msg if there are no items in the list.-->
      <li>No topics have been added yet.</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <!--Render link for NewTopicForm and place it after the list of existing topics.
      Instead of [url 'learning_logs:new_topic'] as it was in a book
       and gave error = ['learning_logs' is not a registered namespace]
       we use [url 'new_topic']
  -->
  <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}">Add a new topic:</a>
