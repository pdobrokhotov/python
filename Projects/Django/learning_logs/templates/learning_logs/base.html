<!-- 
We add a dash after the link to the home page, and then we add
a link to the topics page, using the URL template tag again. 
This line tells Django to generate a link matching the URL pattern
with the name 'topics' in learning_logs/urls.py.
The code from book did NOT work/ So I replaced it from here:

<p> <!-- dash ("-") in the end tags again next href-link! -->
    <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Learning Log</a> -
    <a href="{% url 'topics' %}">Topics</a>
</p>
{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

<!-- This is a tempate that all web-pages wil inherit
The first part of this file creates a paragraph containing the name of
the project, which also acts as a link to the home page. To generate a link,
we use a template tag, indicated by braces and percent signs. A template
tag is a bit of code that generates information to be displayed on a page.
In this example, the template tag [url 'learning_logs:index'] generates
a URL matching the URL pattern defined in learning_logs/urls.py with the
name 'index' u. In this example, learning_logs is the namespace and index is
a uniquely named URL pattern in that namespace.
 
Having the template tag generate the URL for us makes it much easier
to keep our links up to date. To change a URL in our project, we only
need to change the URL pattern in urls.py, and Django will automatically
insert the updated URL the next time the page is requested. Every page in
our project will inherit from base.html, so from now on every page will have
a link back to the home page.

Also we insert a pair of block tags. This block, named content, is a placeholder;
the child template will define the kind of information that goes in
the content block.
A child template doesnâ€™t have to define every block from its parent, so
you can reserve space in parent templates for as many blocks as you like,
and the child template uses only as many as it requires.
