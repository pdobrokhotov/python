<!--                   NOTES 
Each bullet will list two pieces of information: the timestamp and the
full text of each entry. For the timestamp, we display the value of the
attribute date_added. In Django templates, a vertical line (|) represents a
template filter, i.e. a function that modifies the value in a template variable.
The filter date:'M d, Y H:i' displays timestamps in the format January 1,
2015 23:00. The next line displays the full value of text rather than just the
first 50 characters from entry. The filter linebreaks y ensures that long text
entries include line breaks in a format understood by browsers rather than
showing a block of uninterrupted text.
