<!-- 
This template extends base.html, so it has the same base structure as
the rest of the pages in Learning Log. Here we define an HTML form.
The action argument tells the server where to send the data submitted in
the form; in this case, we send it back to the view function new_topic().
The method argument tells the browser to submit the data as a POST request.
Django uses the template tag [csrf_token] to prevent attackers
from using the form to gain unauthorized access to the server (this kind of
attack is called a cross-site request forgery).
-->
{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
  <p>Add a new topic:</p>
  <!-- Instead of [url 'learning_logs:new_topic'] as it was in a book
       and gives error = ['learning_logs' is not a registered namespace]
       we use [url 'new_topic']
  -->
    <form action="{% url 'new_topic' %}" method='post'>

      <!--Display the form; here you see how simple Django can make tasks 
          such as displaying a form. We only need to include the template 
          variable [form.as_p] for Django to create all the fields 
          necessary to display the form automatically. The as_p modifier
          tells Django to render all the form elements in paragraph format, 
          which is a simple way to display the form neatly.
