Installing pygal library 
python -m pip install --user pygal
NOTES:
1)You may need to use the command pip3 instead of pip, and if the command  
still doesnâ€™t work you may need to leave off the --user flag.
2) To see what kind of visualizations are possible with Pygal, visit the gallery of
chart types: go to http://www.pygal.org/, click Documentation, and then click
Chart types. Each example includes source code, so you can see how the
visualizations are generated.
